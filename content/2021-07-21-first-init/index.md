Code splitting is an awesome feature of webpack that can be used to split your code into smaller bundles and can be loaded when necessary or in parallel. If this feature is used properly it can have a very huge impact on the performance improvement of your application. You can look more into code splitting [here](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/) in the official webpack documentation.
